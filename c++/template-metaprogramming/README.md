# `c++/template-metaprogramming`

## Abstract
Demonstrates the use of template metaprogramming (C++17) to create generic, OOP-friendly interfaces.

## Topics
In the code you will find examples of the following:
- How to use the strategy pattern (non-template example)
- How to use C++ class templates to abstract the context/strategy base classes such that they can be specialized for any purpose
- How to use compile-time assertions to ensure concrete implementations of context/strategy class templates are compatible with one another
